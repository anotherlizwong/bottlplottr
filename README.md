Plot bottle caps on any rectangular surface.

#### Assumed cap size
The assumed cap size is 1.15" in diameter.

Measurement: 3 used bottle caps were measured to be...

  * 1.149"
  * 1.205"
  * 1.117"

Assuming most bottle caps are within a small deviation of these sizes, it was deemed acceptable to guestimate bottle caps to be on average 1.15" and a buffer of 0.23" between each cap horizontally. If a bottle cap deviates from this size by a significant amount, it will throw off the plottr.
